## :computer: Support
This only works on Windows,
and won't be ported to other platforms *(for obvious reasons)*.

For all support needed, you can open an issue!
And you can join our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/openm "OpenM Community") server
for further support needed.

## :inbox_tray: Usage
To start, you will need these tools:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Latest [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) release

After installing tools, run these commands to download the tool and its dependencies:
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/OpenM-Project/BEAMinject.git
cd BEAMinject
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the commands are done, you can run the app by double-clicking `BEAMinject.cmd` from the BEAMinject directory.
#### :warning: WARNING
If you didn't install Python with tcl/tk support, you can still use the tool by running `BEAMinjector.py` instead. Note that *this is not recommended*, and we still advise you to modify Python install to add tcl/tk support.
