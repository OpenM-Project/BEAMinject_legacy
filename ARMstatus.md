# :test_tube: ARM support for BEAMinject
Since version 0.3.0, BEAMinject has added support for ARM and ARM64 platforms!

You can download builds [here](https://github.com/OpenM-Project/BEAMinject_ARMbinary).

### :hammer_and_wrench: ARMv7 support
:warning: **WARNING:** No support is provided for ARMv7 platforms. This platform is completely untested.

For ARMv7 *(aka ARM32)*, you need to have a Python runtime and then install dependencies and run manually:
```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
py app.py
```
